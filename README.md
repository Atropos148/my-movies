# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Exercise in React. This webapp was supposed to let you search a movie database, see info about movies and put movies on your favorites list.
Turns out, redux-saga is very complicated for a newcomer. Maybe i'll come back to this in the future.
